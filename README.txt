Towny Advanced is developed by LlmDl.

I took over from ElgarL after MC 1.8 was released. Past developers have included: Shadeness, FuzzieWuzzie, ElgarL. 
With help coming from other developers from time to time including dumptruckman, ole8pie, SwearWord, gravypod, andrewyunt and more.

Towny is one of the oldest still-in-development plugins for Minecraft. It was created by Shadeness for the now-defunct server platform called hMod.
It is the second-oldest land protection plugin to become popular for Minecraft, having been beaten by WorldGuard by just a couple months.

Releases, Dev builds and all other plugins I maintain/dev are available from...
