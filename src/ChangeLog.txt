	Added new config option save_on_load. It's defaulted to off (which is opposite to what it was before). It will no longer to a giant save on startup which assured that what's in memory = saved in file. This should speed up startup of particular large db.
	Files are deleted when the object is deleted. It will not delete existing files, so files deleted outside of towny's regular actions will remain.
	Added allow_resident_plots to enable/disable plot commands, essentially freezing the plot system.
	Fixed admin add command (you couldnt add if you werent a mayor/assistant of any town).

	  appended to signify a range limit on chat.
	  
	  -1 = no limits
	  0 = same world only
	  any positive value = limited range in the same world.
	  
	  eg. - /g,,,towny.chat.global,-1
	        or a local channel that covers 100 blocks range
	        /l,&f[local],&f,towny.chat.local,100
	        
	- Added a 'spleef' plot type (for future development).

	- If a player doesn't have the 'towny.chat.global' permission node, any open chat will pass through for any other plugins to handle.

v0.79.1.13:
	- Fix for me breaking op's wild override.
	- Fix Admin commands from the console.
v0.79.1.14:
	- Flag war mode now supports economy payments for specific events. Those being:
    	- Payment to server -  to place a warflag.
    	- Attacking flagbearer -  pays the defender who broke the flag during a successful defend.
    	- Pillage fund - from defending town during a succesfuly attack. A different amount can be set for the homeblock.
    	  (Using a negative amount for pillaging will instead cause the attacker to pay a 'rebuilding cost'.)
v0.79.1.15:
	- You can no longer stand in a non-pvp area and safely shoot players outside in pvp areas.
	- Prevent TnT being regenerated if destroyed in explosions.
	- Fix Wild perms so it will follow the world settings if no permissions are found.
v0.80.0.0:
	- Release for MC 1.2.4
v0.80.0.1:
	- Fix monster spawning to obey the 'Force Town Mobs' world setting.
	- Add tentative support for Citizens2 to prevent removing NPC created as monsters.
v0.80.0.2:
	- Change Newday code to use iterators instead of creating new arrays (reliability and performance).
v0.80.0.3:
	- Add checks to make sure nations/towns/residents still exist when taxing as it's run in an async thread.
	- Remove the UnclaimedZoneIgnoreId's test when we are using permissions. We should only check the enable/disable flags on the world if the player doesn't have the perms.
v0.80.0.4:
	- Fix Enderman protection block move to follow the world toggle and ignore all other settings.
v0.80.0.5:
	- Move all Combat test functions to their own class. All now available via 'CombatUtil' (for other plugin devs).
v0.80.0.6:
	- Lets have another go at stopping these nations hanging on after they should be removed.

	- Fix cached Wild perms to use the world settings rather than global.
	- More javadocs.
	- Added UID's to the TownyObject for later implementation.
v0.80.0.7:
	- Added a new economy handler with support for...
	  - Register
	  - Vault (will require a build newer than 1.2.15-b172)
	  - Native iConomy 5.01
v0.80.0.8:
	- Moved all player modes under the resident object.
	  Modes can now be toggled using the command '/res toggle [mode]', as well as the already existing '/res set mode [mode]'.
	  An example would be '/res toggle map townclaim'. This would change the state for both of these modes to the opposite of what they were (on/off).
	  Issuing a command of '/res toggle' will clear all modes and set the defaults.
	- Added a new mode '/res toggle plotborder'.
	  This will puff smoke along the plot boundary when you enter a plot to show it's edges. Ideal for marking out plots.
v0.80.0.9:
	- Fix perms for...
	  towny.wild.build/destroy/switch/item_use
	  towny.claimed.build/destroy/switch/item_use
	- Update the TownBlock data when a plot is taken/given back to the town so it will correctly follow the towns permissions once again.
	- Save the town data to preserve the 'for sale' status when a townblock is put up, or taken off sale.
	- Players will now receive a warning message if their town or nation is due for deletion at the next new day tax period.
v0.80.0.10:
	- Move player login code to run in a seperate thread, and configure data retrieval and saving to be syncronized.
	- Rework Towny Regen to 'hopefully' prevent the incorrect world height being set.
	- Outposts can no longer be claimed in worlds which are set as unclaimable.
v0.80.0.11:
	- Rework all PvP and PvM code to properly prevent damage where approriate.
	- Added Villagers to be protected the same as animals when in a town.
	- Added two new Admin commands...
	  '/townyadmin town [name] delete'
	  '/townyadmin nation [name] delete'
	- Fix resident purge so it correctly filters up when updating towns/nations.
	- Better optimize damange prevention
v0.80.0.12:
	- Synchronize backup/delete to prevent lockups.
v0.80.0.13:
	- Simplify Wild and claimed permission nodes to reduce confusion and make the permission tests faster.

	- Fix permission overrides for Towny Ally and outsiders.
v0.80.0.17:

v0.80.1.1:

	- Fix sign removal upon a town deletion.
v0.80.1.3:
	- Fixed integration with Citizens2 for their API changes.

v0.80.1.7:
	- Fix the backup so it will only backup files it can actually read instead of throwing an error.
	- Fix town animal protection so no one can kill the animals in a plot unless they have perms to break grass in that plot.
	- Fix lava/water bucket hack/exploits.
	- Add finer control over block permissions. You can now allow the use of specific block types via permissions.
	  eg.
	    Granting '- towny.wild.build.35' allows a player to place wool blocks in the wilderness.
	    Now you can grant '- towny.wild.destroy.35:1' allowing them to only break brown wool.
	    This adds support for custom block types used in mods such as IndustrialCraft, Redpower etc.
v0.80.1.8:
	- Fix '/plot set' so only the towns mayor or assistants can change town plot types (no outsider mayors).
	- Stop trying to reset a non-existant cache for the Console when using '/ta town <town> add'

	- Really fix the NPE when PEX/GM generates a System update event.

	- Fix for MySQL using tinyint to hold Booleans.
	    SQL datbase names changed for h2 and SQLite databases.
	    If you use this version you need to rename your current h2/sqlite database
	    in the data folder from 'towny' to 'towny.sqldb' or 'towny.h2db'
v0.80.1.11:
	- Added the missing code to handle '/resident toggle {pvp/fire/explosion/mob}'.
v0.80.1.12:
	- Allow your own potions to affect you, even if you have friendly fire turned off.
	- Simplify permission negation so you don't have to negate every data type of a block.

	- New commands
	  '/town rank add/remove <player> <rank>'
	  '/nation rank add/remove <player> <rank>'
	- Added Towny's own permission system (townyperms.yml).
	  This system pushes permissions directly to Bukkit and works along side all other perms plugins.
	  It allows you to define sets of permissions based upon a players status (nomad/resident/mayor/king).
	  You can also assign additional permissions based upon any assigned town/nation ranks (assistant/vip etc).
	  This system is not limited to Towny perms. You can assign any permissions for any plugins in it's groups.
	- Deprecated the following permission nodes (all have replacements)...

      - This includes NPC mayors, the towny-war-chest, and towny-server-account.

      - This is being done because Essentials' economy changes the safe "town-TownNameHere" account to an unsafe "town_TownNameHere" account.
        - Because the _ is used players can log into the server and steal the money.
      - We are now including a warning message at startup to let server admins know that Essentials Economy has been resetting town and nation accounts.
