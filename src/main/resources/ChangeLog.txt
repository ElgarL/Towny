	Added new config option save_on_load. It's defaulted to off (which is opposite to what it was before). It will no longer to a giant save on startup which assured that what's in memory = saved in file. This should speed up startup of particular large db.
	Files are deleted when the object is deleted. It will not delete existing files, so files deleted outside of towny's regular actions will remain.
	Added allow_resident_plots to enable/disable plot commands, essentially freezing the plot system.
	Fixed admin add command (you couldnt add if you werent a mayor/assistant of any town).

    - Added plot regeneration.
      When a town plot is unclaimed (by a player or through upkeep) it will slowly begin to revert to a pre town state.
      Blocks will slowly change back to whatever blocks we're present at the moment the town block was claimed.
      You can configure certain block types you don't want restored to prevent players exploiting regen for diamond ores.
      Block types to not restore are configured in block_ignore in the worlds txt file data/worlds/worldname.txt

	  All custom channels (not town or nation) can now have an extra value
	  appended to signify a range limit on chat.
	  
	  -1 = no limits
	  0 = same world only
	  any positive value = limited range in the same world.
	  
	  eg. - /g,,,towny.chat.global,-1
	        or a local channel that covers 100 blocks range
	        /l,&f[local],&f,towny.chat.local,100
	        
	- Added a 'spleef' plot type (for future development).

v0.78.0.10:
	- Added a new mode '/towny spy', or '/res set mode spy'.
	  This requires you have the permission node 'towny.chat.spy' and be using TownyChat.
	  If you toggle this mode on you will be able to see all town/nation/global, and all custom channel chat.
	- If a player doesn't have the 'towny.chat.global' permission node, any open chat will pass through for any other plugins to handle.

v0.79.1.13:
	- Fix for me breaking op's wild override.
	- Fix Admin commands from the console.
v0.79.1.14:
	- Flag war mode now supports economy payments for specific events. Those being:
    	- Payment to server -  to place a warflag.
    	- Attacking flagbearer -  pays the defender who broke the flag during a successful defend.
    	- Pillage fund - from defending town during a succesfuly attack. A different amount can be set for the homeblock.
    	  (Using a negative amount for pillaging will instead cause the attacker to pay a 'rebuilding cost'.)
v0.79.1.15:
	- You can no longer stand in a non-pvp area and safely shoot players outside in pvp areas.
	- Prevent TnT being regenerated if destroyed in explosions.
	- Fix Wild perms so it will follow the world settings if no permissions are found.
v0.80.0.0:
	- Release for MC 1.2.4
v0.80.0.1:
	- Fix monster spawning to obey the 'Force Town Mobs' world setting.
	- Add tentative support for Citizens2 to prevent removing NPC created as monsters.
v0.80.0.2:
	- Change Newday code to use iterators instead of creating new arrays (reliability and performance).
v0.80.0.3:
	- Add checks to make sure nations/towns/residents still exist when taxing as it's run in an async thread.
	- Remove the UnclaimedZoneIgnoreId's test when we are using permissions. We should only check the enable/disable flags on the world if the player doesn't have the perms.
v0.80.0.4:
	- Fix Enderman protection block move to follow the world toggle and ignore all other settings.
v0.80.0.5:
	- Move all Combat test functions to their own class. All now available via 'CombatUtil' (for other plugin devs).
v0.80.0.6:
	- Lets have another go at stopping these nations hanging on after they should be removed.
	- Refactor a bunch of classes for better organisation. ** Will likely break many plugin hooks due to moved exception classes **
	- Fix cached Wild perms to use the world settings rather than global.
	- More javadocs.
	- Added UID's to the TownyObject for later implementation.
v0.80.0.7:
	- Added a new economy handler with support for...
	  - Register
	  - Vault (will require a build newer than 1.2.15-b172)
	  - Native iConomy 5.01
v0.80.0.8:
	- Moved all player modes under the resident object.
	  Modes can now be toggled using the command '/res toggle [mode]', as well as the already existing '/res set mode [mode]'.
	  An example would be '/res toggle map townclaim'. This would change the state for both of these modes to the opposite of what they were (on/off).
	  Issuing a command of '/res toggle' will clear all modes and set the defaults.
	- Added a new mode '/res toggle plotborder'.
	  This will puff smoke along the plot boundary when you enter a plot to show it's edges. Ideal for marking out plots.
v0.80.0.9:
	- Fix perms for...
	  towny.wild.build/destroy/switch/item_use
	  towny.claimed.build/destroy/switch/item_use
	- Update the TownBlock data when a plot is taken/given back to the town so it will correctly follow the towns permissions once again.
	- Save the town data to preserve the 'for sale' status when a townblock is put up, or taken off sale.
	- Players will now receive a warning message if their town or nation is due for deletion at the next new day tax period.
v0.80.0.10:
	- Move player login code to run in a seperate thread, and configure data retrieval and saving to be syncronized.
	- Rework Towny Regen to 'hopefully' prevent the incorrect world height being set.
	- Outposts can no longer be claimed in worlds which are set as unclaimable.
v0.80.0.11:
	- Rework all PvP and PvM code to properly prevent damage where approriate.
	- Added Villagers to be protected the same as animals when in a town.
	- Added two new Admin commands...
	  '/townyadmin town [name] delete'
	  '/townyadmin nation [name] delete'
	- Fix resident purge so it correctly filters up when updating towns/nations.
	- Better optimize damange prevention
v0.80.0.12:
	- Synchronize backup/delete to prevent lockups.
v0.80.0.13:
	- Simplify Wild and claimed permission nodes to reduce confusion and make the permission tests faster.

	- Major rewrite of the player caching system. Should make things faster when handling most events.
	- Stop resetting the players cache on every location change. Only clear it if we cross a TownBlock boundary.
